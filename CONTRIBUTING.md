# PR Workflow

We use the bors-ng bot to merge PRs. In short, when someone replies `bors r+`,
your PR has been scheduled for final tests and will be automatically merged. If
a maintainer replies `bors delegate+`, then you have been granted the authority
to merge your own PR (usually this will happen if there are some trivial
changes required). For a full list of bors commands,
[see the bors documentation](https://bors.tech/documentation/).
